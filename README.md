Code for paper "Strategy evolution with game transitions in heterogeneous population structures".

The codes include program for functions for theoretical calculations (written by Python 3.7.4). The details for these codes are as follow:

Theoretical calculation:
"absolute measure.py" can be used for the theoretical critical ratio for connected graphs, where the game transition is considered. 

"calculation of threshold.py" can be used for the theoretical critical ratio for connected graphs, where mutation is considered.
