Code for paper "Strategy evolution with game transitions in heterogeneous population structures".

The codes include programs for theoretical calculation functions (written by Python 3.7.4). The details for these codes are as follows:

Theoretical calculation:

"absolute measure.py" can be used for the theoretical critical ratio for connected graphs, where the game transition is considered, including Eq. 37-39 in the main text. 

"calculation of threshold.py" can be used for the theoretical critical ratio for connected graphs, where mutation is considered, including Eq. 37-39 in the main text.
